      A banana is an edible fruit, botanically a berry, produced by 
several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. 
(In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains.) 
The fruit is variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually 
elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind 
which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.

      An orange is a type of citrus fruit which people often eat. 
Oranges are a very good source of vitamins, especially vitamin C.[1] 
Orange juice is an important part of many people's breakfast. The "sweet 
orange", which is the kind that are most often eaten today, grew first 
in Asia but now grows in many parts of the world.
	  Oranges are round orange-coloured fruit that grow on a tree 
which can reach 10 metres high. Orange trees have dark green shiny 
leaves and small white flowers with five petals. The flowers smell very 
sweet which attracts many bees.

      Packed with more vitamin C than an equivalent amount of orange, 
the bright green flesh of the kiwifruit speckled with tiny black seeds 
adds a dramatic tropical flair to any fruit salad. California kiwifruit 
is available November through May, while the New Zealand crop hits the 
market June through October making fresh kiwis available year round.
